# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting Google stock prices using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The project is divided into two main scripts:
- **`train_model.py`**: Preprocesses training data, builds and trains an LSTM model, and saves the trained model along with the scaler.
- **`test_model.py`**: Loads the saved model and scaler, processes test data (e.g., 2024 data), makes predictions, and visualizes the results. It also calculates the RMSE and RÂ² score.
